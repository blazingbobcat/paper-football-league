Paper football league -- Pygame 1.9.4

Created in Python 3.6.3

<b>Welcome to the Paper Football league!</b>

This simple game will have you launching paper footballs over a wooden goal post.  Hopefully some high school memories will come back.  Click and drag an arrow to launch the ball at the desired angle.  This is version 1.0, which includes the following features:

- Realistic sound effects
- Pseudo 3D graphics
- Wind element to increase challenge
- One or two players competitive
- Choose up to five minutes of game time

I would like to thank Mike Koenig, Stephan Schutez, GoGo, Popup Pixels and Mark DiAngelo for their sound effect samples from SoundBible.com used in this game.  I would also like to thank Guido van Rossum for creating such an easy-to-learn programming language, and the creator(s) of Pygame for granting me the ability to write my own computer games.  All other stuff is made by me.  Feedback is always appreciated.
