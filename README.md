Paper football league -- Pygame 1.9.2

Created in Python 3.6.3

<b>Welcome to the Paper Football league!</b>

This simple game will have you launching paper footballs over a wooden goal post.  Hopefully some high school memories will come back.  Click and drag an arrow to launch the ball at the desired angle.  The beta version 1.0 has only one player trying to score as many goals under one minute.  The final version will include the following features:

- Realistic sound effects
- Pseudo 3D graphics
- Wind element to increase challenge
- One or two players competitive
- Choose up to five minutes of game time

The final version will be completed shortly, but the beta version already has almost all these features.  Feel free to give it a try and give me feedback after.  It would be greatly appreciated.
